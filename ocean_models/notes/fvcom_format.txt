VARIABLES
x - x coord of each node
y - y coord of each node
lon - lon of each node (not always used)
lat - lat of each node (not always used)
xc - x coord of triangles
yc - y coord of triangles
siglay, siglev = sigma coords used to calculate used to calculate  z
h - water depth at node
center = water depth at center
nv = nodes that make up a triangle
zeta = water surface elevation
——height above sea surface level
u - eastward water velocity
v - northward water velocity

ww - vertical velocity
au - horz averaged velocity
uv - vert averaged velocity
temp - temp…calculated at nodes
salinity - salinity….calculated at nodes
